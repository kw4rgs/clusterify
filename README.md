## Requirements

Hardware Requirements:

A computer or server with sufficient processing power and memory to handle the size and complexity of your dataset. The exact requirements may vary depending on the scale of your data.
Software Requirements:

-   Python: Clusterify is built using Python, so you'll need a compatible version installed on your machine.
-   FastAPI: Ensure you have FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python, installed.
-   Pandas: Install the Pandas library to leverage its powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities.
-   Numpy: Install Numpy, a fundamental package for scientific computing, to support advanced numerical operations.
-   Scikit-learn: Install Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, which includes the implementation of the K-means algorithm and nearest neighbor methods.

Any additional libraries or packages required for your specific data preprocessing, visualization, or analysis needs.

Data Requirements:

-   Prepare your data in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or other structured formats) suitable for input into Clusterify.
-   Ensure the data points are appropriately formatted, with features or attributes that capture the relevant information for clustering.
-   It's worth noting that specific version requirements for Python, FastAPI, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and other dependencies may vary. It's always recommended to refer to the documentation of each library for the latest version compatibility information.

Additionally, if you plan to deploy Clusterify on a server or in a production environment, you may need to consider additional requirements such as hosting infrastructure, security measures, and scalability considerations.

## Instructions

1) You must "sudo apt-get install build-essential", cause K-means-constrained need it

## Information

-   K-means is a clustering algorithm that tries to partition a set of points into K sets (clusters) such that the points in each cluster tend to be near each other. 
It is unsupervised because the points have no external classification.

-   K-nearest neighbors is a classification (or regression) algorithm that in order to determine the classification of a point, combines the classification of the K nearest points. 
It is supervised because you are trying to classify a point based on the known classification of other points.
