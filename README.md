## Information 📢

-   K-means is a clustering algorithm that tries to partition a set of points into K sets (clusters) such that the points in each cluster tend to be near each other. 
It is unsupervised because the points have no external classification.

-   K-nearest neighbors is a classification (or regression) algorithm that in order to determine the classification of a point, combines the classification of the K nearest points. 
It is supervised because you are trying to classify a point based on the known classification of other points.

## Requirements 📝

**Hardware Requirements:**

A computer or server with sufficient processing power and memory to handle the size and complexity of your dataset. The exact requirements may vary depending on the scale of your data.
Software Requirements:

-   Python: Clusterify is built using Python, so you'll need a compatible version installed on your machine.
-   FastAPI: Ensure you have FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python, installed.
-   Pandas: Install the Pandas library to leverage its powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities.
-   Numpy: Install Numpy, a fundamental package for scientific computing, to support advanced numerical operations.
-   Scikit-learn: Install Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, which includes the implementation of the K-means algorithm and nearest neighbor methods.

Any additional libraries or packages required for your specific data preprocessing, visualization, or analysis needs.

**Data Requirements:**

-   Prepare your data in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or other structured formats) suitable for input into Clusterify.
-   Ensure the data points are appropriately formatted, with features or attributes that capture the relevant information for clustering.
-   It's worth noting that specific version requirements for Python, FastAPI, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and other dependencies may vary. It's always recommended to refer to the documentation of each library for the latest version compatibility information.

Additionally, if you plan to deploy Clusterify on a server or in a production environment, you may need to consider additional requirements such as hosting infrastructure, security measures, and scalability considerations.

## Documentation 📚

**FastAPI doc**

All the necessary documentation will be available through the URL: 

    

> server ip:port/docs

or 

> server ip:port/redoc

**Endpoints**

1) Health Check:

This endpoint is used to check the health status of the server.

>    - Endpoint: /Check Health
>    - HTTP Method: GET


2) Cluster Centroids:

This endpoint retrieves the cluster centroids, these represent the central points or prototypes of each cluster. This endpoint allows you to fetch the coordinates or attributes of these centroids.

>    - Endpoint: /api/v1/cluster_centers
>    - HTTP Method: GET

3) Cluster Information:
 
This endpoint provides information about the clustered data. It retrieves the data points that have been assigned to specific clusters. 

>    - Endpoint: /api/v1/clustered_data
>    - HTTP Method: GET


4) Classify Customers:

This endpoint is used to classify customers. It accepts a POST request and typically requires providing customer data as input. Clusterify will process the data and classify customers based on predefined criteria or machine learning models. The response will contain the classification results, such as the predicted customer segments or labels. It can be an object or a list of objects.

## Instructions 🚀

> I will use "ubuntu" for practical purposes..


To deploy and install your project, you can follow these instructions:

1. Update your system:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Upgrade installed packages:
   ```
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. Install Python 3 virtual environment package:
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```

4. Navigate to the `/opt` directory:
   ```
   cd /opt
   ```

5. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cristianzzzz/clusterify.git
   ```

6. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /opt/clusterify
   ```

7. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

8. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

9. Install the required build essentials (for K-means-constrained):
   ```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

10. Install Python development headers (for K-means-constrained):
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    ```

11. Install the project dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

12. Test the project by running it with Uvicorn:
    ```
    uvicorn clusterify:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
    ```

    Make sure to replace `clusterify:app` with the correct module and application object if needed.

Tip: To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` in the terminal.

To deploy as web service, follow these additional steps:

1. Open the systemd service configuration file in a text editor:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/clusterify.service
   ```

2. Paste the following content into the file:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Clusterify FastAPI Application
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=<your_username>
   Group=<your_groupname>
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/clusterify
   ExecStart=/opt/clusterify/env/bin/uvicorn clusterify:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Replace `<your_username>` and `<your_groupname>` with your actual username and group name.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Enable the service to start on boot:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable clusterify.service
   ```

5. Start the service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start clusterify.service
   ```

Now, your application should be deployed and running as a systemd service. It will automatically start on boot and restart if it crashes.
